## About

The goal of AVA is to unite and standardize vegetation data from the Arctic that will give researchers a unique opportunity to analyze vegetation at pan-arctic scale. The initiative is endorsed by the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna of the Arctic Council and the International Arctic Science Committee.

At present, AVA consists of about 30’000 data plots, mostly from Alaska, Canada and Scandinavia, stored in Arctic regional databases. The Russian AVA section is under rapid development. In cooperation with data authors we are working on archiving and harmonizing information on the vegetation composition of the Russian Arctic. Our website presents the Russian AVA data and provides an overview of available data for downloading. Access to the AVA data is diverse: previously published data could bedownloaded directly and unpublished data – after a confirmation given by the dataset author (user agreement signing is needed)  

A.N. Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution RAS leads the effort. HSE Tikhonov Moscow Institute of Electronics and Mathematics provides technical assistance for the website. Project is supported by RFBR 18-04-01010 А.
